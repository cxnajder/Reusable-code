Here are some basic Pascal code examples that I believe are worth keeping. <br />
Some Pascal functions have unusual syntax, so these code samples serve as a cheat sheet for me in case I forget some of it.

The code samples are mostly copied from a YouTube Pascal tutorial that I've been following while learning Pascal for the first time: [YouTube Pascal Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB24C56953A79987A)

Even though this tutorial is very basic, Pascal syntax can be tricky sometimes, so I found it very helpful.
